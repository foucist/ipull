iPull is a social experiment inspired by a book on [The New Culture of Learning][0] and an essay on [Bad Education][1]. It is based on the assumption that in the coming years, for high school graduates interested in certain careers, there will be a shift away from universities, where in the past it had been seen as compulsory. The underlying forces of this shift will be:

* The prevelance of free, high quality, easily accessible knowledge, thanks to entities like Google, Wikipedia, and [Kahn Academy][2].
* The cost to acquire many college degrees will unquestionably outpace the typical graduate's ability to payoff the loans without severely limiting their career options.

With the cost of knowledge approaching zero, and the cost of a college degree outpacing wage increases, and the irrevocability of student loans, more high school graduates will be looking for alternatives.

This experiment is meant to explore one of many alternatives.

At it's most extreme, it is a platform for courses to be proposed by the people interested in learning a subject. A motivated learner chooses the price, class size range, dates, times, duration of a course and creates an initial description. The learner then commits to paying the price for the course if a minimum number of learners also commit. Once the course begins, the learners' are charged the price. For anyone who successfully completes and passes the course, they will be able to easily receive their money back, with interest. The could also use that money to buy another course. Or award take some of that money and award it to their most helpful classmates.

A less extreme scenario would include a more traditional teacher or facilitator role. And in this case, the person (or people) taking on this responsibility would be paid a flat fee, plus any voluntary awards from the learners.

This will be a non-profit entity. The codebase for iPull will be freely available via open source.
